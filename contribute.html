            <h2>Volunteer</h2>
            <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and
                ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind
                the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and
                volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.</p>
            <p>You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more
                about how you can get involved.</p>
